# DraggableYoutubeFloatingVideo

DraggableYoutubeFloatingVideo allows you to play videos on a floating mini window at the bottom of your screen from sites like YouTube, Vimeo & Facebook or custom video url , yes you have to specify URL for that. 

Usage
-----
Initialize from a storyboard id  programmatically. Set the video URL , then you're pretty much good to go! Check out the demo app to see how it can be used.


How it works
------------
This demo app will animate the view just like Youtube mobile app, while tapping on video a UIView pops up from right corner of the screen and the view can be dragged to  right corner through Pan Gesture and more features are there as Youtube iOS app
